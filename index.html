        		<h1>Introduction</h1>
				  <p>
            I am a master's student in the <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/">Department of Biomedical Engineering</a> at the
            <a href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Enginering</a> and a Graduate Research Assistant 
            in the 
            <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/">Department of Biostatistics</a> at the
            <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a>.
            My thesis work is on the <a href="https://www.opencasestudies.org/">Open Case Studies</a> project from the
            <a href="https://jhudatascience.org/">Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab</a> advised by
            <a href="https://carriewright11.github.io/">Dr. Carrie Wright</a>. Open Case Studies is a repository of
            open source data science case studies on current public health problems using real datasets. My project is 
            updating the current case studies by removing barriers, implementing interactive elements, and expanding their reach.
            My master's thesis will analyze the impact of these updates on data science education inside and outside the classroom.

            I find the brain fascinating and want to further our understanding of it. I am excited by the discoveries made 
            possible by computational models and analyses in neuroscience and want to contribute to these pursuits.
            Through my course I've focused my studies on
            <a href="https://www.bme.jhu.edu/research/research-areas/neuroengineering/">neuroengineering</a> and 
            <a href+"https://www.bme.jhu.edu/research/research-areas/biomedical-data-science/">biomedical data science</a>. The
            classes I've taken in these areas have allowed me to practice wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing real biological 
            data such as brain images, neural recordings, covid-19 cases and more. Post-graduation, I hope to gain industry
            experience working as a data scientist in biotech, ideally with neurological data. Later on, I plan to pursue a Ph.D in 
            computational neuroscience.
