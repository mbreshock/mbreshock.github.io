I am currently a researcher at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/), an independent population health research organization based at the [University of Washington School of Medicine](https://www.uwmedicine.org/school-of-medicine). I work in the [Resource Tracking](https://www.healthdata.org/health-financing) division on the Domestic Health Accounts: Dementia Spending sub-team under the supervision of [Joseph Dieleman](https://www.healthdata.org/about/joseph-dieleman) and [Amy Lastuka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-lastuka-40b962/). Our project is estimating the total cost of informal care for people with dementia in the US by state. These estimates includes the replacement cost of using an informal caregiver instead of professioinal care as well as the cost of forgone wages and loss of leisure time for the informal caregiver. These estimates are calculated using caregiving hours extracted from the following national surveys:
  - [National Health & Aging Trends Study (NHATS) / National Study of Caregiving (NSOC)](https://www.nhats.org/)
  - [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html)
  - [The Health and Retirement Study (HRS)](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/about)

and wages/costs extracted from the following data sources: 
  - [U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/)
  - [U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html)
  - [Genworth Cost of Care Survey](https://www.genworth.com/aging-and-you/finances/cost-of-care.html)

Previiously, I was a master's student/research assistant working on the [Open Case Studies](https://www.opencasestudies.org/) project. This project is a product of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](https://jhudatascience.org/) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/). In December 2021, I graduated with a master's degree from the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/) at the [Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/). My thesis work was about [Open Case Studies](https://www.opencasestudies.org/) and advised by [Dr. Carrie Wright](https://carriewright11.github.io/). Learn more about my work at Hopkins in the [Projects tab](./projects.html).

I am excited by the power of data science to extract meaning and information from data. Computational methods and tool-kits are enabling novel discoveries and innovations in all facets of life. I would like to contribute to these pursuits, particularly in the realms of biology and health. Throughout my graduate program I've focused my studies on [neuroengineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/research/research-areas/neuroengineering/) and [biomedical data science](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/research/research-areas/biomedical-data-science/). Through my [courses](./coursesskills.html) and research in graduate school, I was able to wrangle, analyze, and visualize real biological data including brain images, neural recordings, [Covid-19 cases](https://mbreshock.shinyapps.io/covid_dashboard/) and more. \

*My work at IHME is developed using [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) for version control instead of GitHub due to privacy concerns, data use agreements (DUA) and the sensitive nature of the datasets we use. For this reason my most recent work is not open-access and my contribution history since starting at IHME is non-existent on GitHub.*
