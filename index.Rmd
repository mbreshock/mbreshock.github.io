I am currently a researcher at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://www.healthdata.org/), an independent population health research organization based at the [University of Washington School of Medicine](https://www.uwmedicine.org/school-of-medicine). I work in the [Resource Tracking](https://www.healthdata.org/health-financing) division on the Domestic Health Accounts: Dementia Spending sub-team under the supervision of [Joseph Dieleman, PhD](https://www.healthdata.org/about/joseph-dieleman) and [Amy Lastuka, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-lastuka-40b962/).  Our project is estimating the economic burden of dementia care in the US and globally using survey and administrative data. Cost estimates are created by processing, analyzing, visualizing and modeling this data in R and Python using standard data science and statistical methods. I presented a [poster](./pubsprez.html) detailing the results of our US work at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference 2023 in Amsterdam. I also host weekly office hours to provide R programming support for fellow researchers and analysts at the institute as an R expert.

Previously, I was a master's student/research assistant working on the [Open Case Studies](https://www.opencasestudies.org/) project. This project is a product of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](https://jhudatascience.org/) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/). In December 2021, I graduated with a master's degree from the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/) at the [Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/). My thesis work was about [Open Case Studies](https://www.opencasestudies.org/) and advised by [Carrie Wright, PhD](https://carriewright11.github.io/). Learn more about my work at Hopkins in the [Projects tab](./projects.html).

Throughout my graduate program I've focused my studies on [neuroengineering](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/research/research-areas/neuroengineering/) and [biomedical data science](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/research/research-areas/biomedical-data-science/). Through my [courses](./coursesskills.html) and research, I processed, analyzed, and visualized real biomedical data including brain images, electrophysiological recordings, [Covid-19 cases](https://mbreshock.shinyapps.io/covid_dashboard/) and more.

I am excited by the power of data science to extract meaning and information from data. Computational methods and tool-kits are enabling novel discoveries and innovations in all facets of life, especially with artificial intelligence and machine learning. As new technologies are developed, special care must be taken to ensure it is used ethically and responsibly. As my career progresses, I'd like to help ensure that AI/ML is used to promote more social good and minimize possible damages. I am particularly excited by the potential of AI/ML to decode neural signals and enable robust brain-machine interfaces.\

*My work at IHME is developed using [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product) for version control instead of GitHub due to privacy concerns, data use agreements (DUA) and the sensitive nature of the datasets we use. For this reason my most recent work is not open-access and my contribution history since starting at IHME is nearly non-existent on GitHub.*
